                    <h2>Little Bit About Us</h2>
    
                    <p>
                        When we opened, what we now know as “contemporary barber culture” didn’t exist, and our first shop was created out of necessity. In NYC in 2006, there were two options for haircuts: to make an appointment at a salon and pay $90 and up or to pay a visit to the closest barbershop charging an average of $12 for a limited range of haircut styles and uneven quality. 
                        We wanted to provide an elevated and relevant sense of style with our barbering service, with a convenient, walk-in wait list and a $40 price point. Since then we have spawned a new barbering subculture, raised the overall barbering wage nationwide, and created new jobs by elevating the craft of barbering.
                    </p>
<h3>Our Shops</h3>
<p>  Since opening in 2006 in Downtown New York City, we have grown independently to multiple locations in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles with talented, highly trained barbers. Along the way, we developed our own grooming product line, which is now being sold in barbershops and retailers worldwide.
    
    This is not a trend. This is a tradition. One we hope to preserve and grow.
    
    Our company is built on people, style and skill. Each one of our shops embodies the individuality of its staff and the neighborhood. You will find a consistent quality throughout each location, but with a unique aesthetic inspired by the diversity of the neighborhood and clientele.
    
    This is not a trend. This is a tradition. One we hope to preserve and grow.
 
    We offer expertly crafted, professional quality grooming products. Fellow hair products are designed to work for most men’s hair styles.
    
    As part of our commitment to quality craftsmanship, all of our products are made in the USA and are paraben and sulfate free. Scented with 100% natural essentials oils extracted from herbs, trees, fruits, flowers and other plants that remind us of Northern California’s coastal Redwoods and Southern California’s citrus orchards.
    
    Our hair, styling and shave formulas have been developed in accordance with our own barbers’ strict standards, to provide top-shelf products that evoke the experience of visiting one of our barbershops.
